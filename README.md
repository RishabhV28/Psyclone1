## About
- Psyclone is a platform that provides psychology students with ai patients to practice their therapy skills and gain hands-on experience
 ## Features
- AI-Powered Virtual Patients: An interactive chatbot that simulates patients with
various mental health disorders
- Realistic Conversational Flow: The AI mimics natural speech, emotional
responses, and symptom expression to replicate real-world patient interactions

- Customizable Scenarios: Students can select conditions (e.g., depression,
schizophrenia), patient backgrounds, and difficulty levels for tailored practice
sessions.

- Built-In Feedback System: After each session, the platform provides feedback of
student performanceâ€”highlighting empathy, missed cues, and diagnostic
accuracy
- Gamification of the progress using user rating and difficulty for patients
- Competitiveness environment by comparing your result to others

## Feasibility
- This project can be presented as leetcode but for
therapists, similar to how leetcode questions help a
programming student with their credibility , psyclone
can help therapists get the training they need.
- A freemium model can be introduced which allows
users to create their own characters and use them as
virtual patients or we can have patient difficulty similar
to chess bots.
- Analytical feedback can also be provided to students
for their therapy skills

## Viability
This project is very much required in the
current world as their is no way for
therapists to actually improve their skills
without hands on experience with patients.
With improvement in ai technology the
platform will continue to become better and
can become a haven for the psychology
industry.
